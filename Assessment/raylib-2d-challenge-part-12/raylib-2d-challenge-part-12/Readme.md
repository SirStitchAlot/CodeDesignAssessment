# RayLib 2D Challenge - Part 11

Code developed as part of the RayLib 2D Challenge; a challenge to see how easy it is to create a proto 2D platform game using RayLib. You can follow it here: https://keasigmadelta.com/blog/tag/raylib-2d-challenge 

The video & summary for this part can be found at:

## Usage
Have a look at the source code. To run the code, you need to:
- Build the code using a suitable compiler (see below)
- Download the extra resources (see Resources.txt)

## Building

The source code can be built with CMake and a suitable C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio, XCode). Dependencies not included in ThirdParty/ will be automatically downloaded and installed. 

The following commands will build the project (executed in the root directory):
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

After executing the above, you can rebuild the code by executing "cmake --build ." inside the build/ subdirectory that you created.
